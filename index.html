            <p>Welcome to CAPTCHR</p> <br>
            A speculative Net.Art experience that explores how CAPTCHAs define the boundary between human and computer.<br><br>
            CAPTCHAs require humans to prove that they're not robots by passing tests designed to be impossible for computers.<br><br>
            
            The answers to these tests are used to build databases that allow computers to gain more human-like abilities.<br><br>
            As computers become more capable at completing human tasks, what will future CAPTCHAs test and what kind of human data will they capture?
